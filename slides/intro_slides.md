# Welcome to C++

- - -

which is…

- notorious for being *hard*
- looks easy at first glance
- easy to get wrong / fail completely

> "If your program segfaults, consider yourself lucky."

- - -

, but over time you will…

- learn useful techniques
- learn how to prevent errors & pitfalls
- better understand its internals
- be able to overcome challenges

- - -

Sounds tough. Why'd I do that?

- succeeding feels extremely rewarding
- learned techniques can be applied elsewhere
- it's not for everyone, hence you are special ❤️

- - -

C++ is used where the real shit happens:

- high performance computing (HPC)
- compiler research
- game engines
- low-level robotics
- …
