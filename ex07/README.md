# Exercise Sheet 7 â€“ Becoming more meta

*due on 14 December 2018*

## Task 1 (3 Points)

You are given the following code snippet of a mathematical vector.

```cpp
template <std::size_t N>
class Vector {
  public:
    /* ... */

  private:
    std::array<double, N> data;
};
```

Implement the following functions for `Vector`:
- componentwise addition via `operator+`
- `to_string`

Find an elegant way to provide the following interface:
- on default construction (no arguments), all elements are initialised to zero
- besides copy / move constructor and assignment, there is only one more constructor which takes exactly `N` `double`s to initialise `data`
- accessing elements via the subscript operator `operator[]`
- members `.x`, `.y`, `.z` access `data[0]`, `data[1]`, `data[2]` respectively
    - with `N == 1` there should be only `.x` available
    - with `N == 2` there should be `.x` and `.y` available
    - with `N == 3` there should be `.x`, `.y`, and `.z` available

While striving for the most elegant solution, keep your intermediate ones for the lab.

Add a few tests to ensure correct behaviour using the following aliases:

```cpp
using Vec1 = Vector<1>;
using Vec2 = Vector<2>;
using Vec3 = Vector<3>;
```

*Note:* You are allowed to modify the given snippet as necessary.

## Task 2 (3 Points)

Revisit the meta programming example from the lecture regarding `std::tuple`.

Given the following class template:

```cpp
template <typename... Types>
class type_set {};
```

`type_set` should behave like a set of types.
The empty set would therefore be `type_set<>`, while the set containing the type `int` would be `type_set<int>`, so on and so forth.

- Create a meta function `type_set_contains_v` which checks if a given `type_set` contains a given type.
- Create a meta function `type_set_is_subset_v` which checks if a given `type_set` is a subset of another given `type_set`.
- Create a meta function `type_set_is_same_v` which checks if a given `type_set` is equal to another given `type_set`.
- Create a meta function `type_set_size_v` which tells the size of a given `type_set`.
  For `type_set<int, int, float>` it should return 2.

Try not to use any of the utilities provided by the standard library (like the example provided in the lecture).

*Hint:* If you are struggling with this exercise you might want to have a look at how *fold* (ie *reduce*) is used in functional programming languages.
